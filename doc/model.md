## Models

Models are likely one of the most important settings for getting a specific image or type or image. Certain models, like AlbedoBase, are generalists. They can generate nearly any kind of image, if prompted correctly. Others, like ICBINP, are realistic. They work quite well for realistic images, but fall short for stylized or anime. Anything Diffusion works well for anime, as an example.

Another property of models that can vary widely are their baseline. This determines, among other things, their resolution and preferred settings. There are, as of 10/11/2024, 5 common baselines. However, SD 1.5 and 2.1 share many characteristics.

### SD 1.5 and 2.1

Stable Diffusion 1.5 models are generally considered out of date, but there are a few that remain as a niche.
SD 2.1 is similar to 1.5 in many ways.

### SD XL

#### Pony

Pony models are based on SDXL, but are different enough that they can reasonably be treated as a new baseline. Most Pony models are trained on Danbooru and E621 tags, and can accurately depict common tags from them. More on that in [prompting](/doc/prompt.md#danbooru-tagging). Pony models also require CLIP Skip 2.
