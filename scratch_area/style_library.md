# Style Library

The Style Library, to a user, lets them save certain configurations. They can, for example, save "PonyXL" as being "score_9, score_8, score_7, {p}", CS 2, etc. Pony Realism has a similar idea, but different config. Then, with the single prompt "long_hair, brown_eyes", etc, it makes jobs for both Pony Realism and PonyXL
