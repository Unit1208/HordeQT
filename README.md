# HordeQT

**A local frontend to the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net).**

HordeQT is written in [Python](https://python.org), using the [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) library for Qt bindings.

> [!WARNING]
> HordeQT is written to be cross-platform, and will work on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. However, due to code signing restrictions, **I can not provide a MacOS build**.

The only requirements to build are: python>=3.10, pip, and venv. `build.py` will install all other dependencies automatically if it can.
